## Option 1

Build a classic game from your childhood, using React and ES6.

You might choose from one of the following:

- Noughts and Crosses
- Connect Four
- Battleships

But the choice is yours!

## Option 2

Build a product page for a cosmetics shop using the [Makeup API](https://makeup-api.herokuapp.com/) we saw on Monday.

Users should be able to filter and/or sort the page somehow (e.g. show only products by COVERGIRL, sort items by price...)
